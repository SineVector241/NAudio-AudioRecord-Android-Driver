# NAudio-AudioRecord-Android-Driver
An implementation of WaveInEvent from NAudio to support Android Devices using AudioRecord API. Some code was copied from https://gist.github.com/neilt6/6d07322070470536ea0ba409c343c2a5 which I have to thank the author of that and also the NAudio Contributors for WaveInEvent.cs class.
